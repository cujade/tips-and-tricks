# SETUP (MONDAY) (10min)
- Earlier last semester I gave a talk called "Why Software Sucks"
	- And here I am talking to you about how to do web development
	- I am also a CS major
		- This makes me a hypocrite
	- If software sucks then why am I doing this
		- You'll meet amazing people (that's why we're visiting tech companies)
		- You'll feel super powerful, and start building things ASAP
		- Empowering and effective use of time
	- It happens that web development is one of the most rewarding ways to get into developing software/learning to code
		- Every single one of you is going to make a personal website
		- The world can see it - an hour a day, for 5 days, for exposure to the entire world
			- That's crazy!
	- Let's get started

- Register on GitHub
- Get Student Developer Pack (columbia email)
- Download Sublime Text 3
- Git
	- git config --global user.name  "Neil Chen"
	- git config --global user.email "neil.chen@columbia.edu"
- Basic command line use
	- Terminal, Powershell
	- cd
	- ls

# HTML (MONDAY) (40min)
- HTML
	- hypertext markup language
		- annotating a text to stylize it
	- structure of a website
		- https://zachlatta.com/
	- content of a website - all the text
- tags
	- element names surrounded by angle brackets
	- start tag and end tag
	- html tags normally come in opening and closing tags
- elements
	- header tags, h1-h6, hierarchy
	- anchor tags (links to parts of this page or another page)
- paths (relative vs. absolute)
	- relative paths are relative to something
	- working directory
	- absolute paths point to the same thing regardless of current working directory
- doctype declaration
	- tells browser to render html (turn it into visible stuff)
- comments
	- not rendered by the browser
- head vs body
	- head encapsulates meta elements - information about the contents, title of the page, files that the document is going to need
		- loaded before the page displays
	- body encapsulates the content of the website
		- anything you want displayed
		- loaded after the head
- formatting convention
	- indentation
- file organization
	- paths
- divs
	- define a division or section in an html document
- good practice
	- use divs sparingly
	- block vs inline element(?)
- element inspector
## Project
- Header + picture + paragraph + links
