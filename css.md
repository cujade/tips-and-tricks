# REVIEW (TUESDAY) (5min)

- What do we think about web development so far?
- 'Web development' is a pretty nebulous term. Any website on the Internet has to be developed.
	- Just a single page of plaintext (www.example.com)
	- To complex internet applications (Facebook)
- Interdisciplinary
	- Graphic design
	- Web design
	- Search engine optimization
	- Mobile responsiveness
- Frontend dev
	- Client-side
	- What the user sees
		- UI elements - menus, dropdowns, transitions
- Backend dev
	- Server-side
	- What happens behind the scenes
		- Control data and behaviors - a todo list app might save things to a database on the server side
- Full stack dev
	- e.g. Jean from Fundera
	- Both frontend and backend
	- Working knoweldge of both ends is useful
- For JADE, we'll focus on the frontend
	- Explore the backend a little bit
- HTML describes the **structure** and content of a website
- CSS describes the **presentation** of a webpage
	- Color
	- Layout
	- Font

- Formatted as selector { property: value } ...
	- selector - a pattern used to select the elements you want to style
	- the way this works is, styles are applied to specific elements
	- but html elements can be nested
	- **cascading** - more specific styles are applied with a higher priority than less specific styles
		- similar to inheritance for you object-oriented philes
- IDs and Classes
	- id's only apply to a single element - good for a single button for example
	- classes can apply to multiple elements -good for applying the same styling to multiple divs
- Inline vs External
	- yuo can also write css internally - <style> </style> in your <head></head>
		- if put in body, it will load after
	- you can write css inline or in a separate file + link to that file in your html
	- divs define a section or division
- font-size
	- em vs. px. vs pt. vs %
		- em - 1em = current document font size
		- px - fixed-size, but does not scale to fit mobile devices
		- pt - 1/72", usually not used
		- %  - like em, where curr. doc. font size = 100%
- line-height
	- minimum height of line boxes within element
	- line box - like a line of text, imagine a rectangular box enclosing a line of text
- font-size
	- size of font lol
- font-family
	- Serif vs. sans serif
	- Kerning
- color
- position
- width/height
- text-align
- the "Box Model"
	- padding
	- border
	- margin
- linking external css
	- <link href="..." rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> <<< but it turns out type defaults to text/css for html5
